# Text Editing Katas for Team Learning

(This is actually a collection of files to set up some text editing katas for a HIDS Team Learning exercise.  See the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for more on that.  The rest of this README will pretend to be for the project that, well, this pretends to be.)

This is a **Super Important Program (for doing super-important things)**

You can tell it's important because it's a .NET project, and has unit tests and acceptance tests.
