# Production Operation

Running this in production is super easy.

Here are the instructions.

1. Make sure it's plugged in
2. Make sure the power switch is set to ON.
3. Set the choke
4. Pull the starter pull (you might have to do this several times)
5. Run the `start_production.sh` script.
6. Log in and verify that production is running.
7. If it is not, hit it with a stick.
   1. The stick should be solid enough to make it go "clang"
   1. The stick should be make of a North American hardwood.  But not Canadian.  Definitely not softwood.
   1. A diameter of 1.5", +/- 0.25", is recommended.
   1. One hit only, then go back to step 1.
4. If it is (running, that is) turn the choke off
9. All done!
